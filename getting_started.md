# Getting Started
The boilerplate or starter code for the web application is hosted on Github.  It can be found here:  [Link](https://github.com/P2PLisa/angularworkshop)

In order to get a copy of the code from Github onto your computer, you can use git to clone it if you're familiar with it or you can just download the zip file containing the code.
If you'd like to clone, here are some helpful instructions:  [Instructions Here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
