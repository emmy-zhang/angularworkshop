# Getting Started

Create a Github account.  Github is found here:  [Link](https://github.com/)

Create an account for Heroku.  Heroku is found here:  [Link](https://www.heroku.com/)

Now, we will need to create a repository on Github and then link Heroku to it.

Blah Blah Blah

Next, fork this repository [here](https://github.com/thesoupgirl/angularworkshop) by clicking 'fork' in the top right hand corner.
Clone the repository following these instructions:  [Instructions Here](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)

Next, set up Heroku to deploy from the branch you're currently on, which is most likely named master.  Instructions for that can be found here:  [Click Here](https://developer.github.com/guides/automating-deployments-to-integrators/)

Congrats!  Now you should be able to see your own version of the app deployed.  Let's go onto editing it to make it your own...
